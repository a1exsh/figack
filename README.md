# figack.core

Recreational project to learn Clojure(Script) while hopefully having some fun!

## Overview

Dungeons and Dragons a-la NetHack, using ClojureScript.

## Development

### Prerequisites

1. Install `clj` CLI tool: https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started#_clojure_installer_and_cli_tools
2. Get yourself familiar with: https://figwheel.org/
3. Start the web server:
```{.clj}
user=> (load "figack/server/core")
user=> (in-ns 'figack.server.core)
figack.server.core=> (start!)
```

To get an interactive development environment run:

    clojure -M:fig:build

This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    rm -rf target/public

To create a production build run:

    rm -rf target/public
    clojure -M:fig:min

Then open the landing page URL: http://localhost:8080/index.html
